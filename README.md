## Development notes: 

For this project, I was provided with a list of user stories that I needed to implement for the project. <br/>
All the user stories are provided in the user_stories.txt, but they can broken down in to the following pages and features. <br/>

#### Contacts:
Feature 1: User must be able to **add** and **remove** other users of the application. 
* I decided to make it so if an user is not apart of the application then it will email  them an  <br/> invitation instead of an error.
* User needs to provide an email address to add people to thier contacts <br/>

Feature 2: User can set a customizable nickname and profile image for thier contacts <br/>

#### Meetings:
Feature 1: User can make an calendar where they can pick preference levels for upcoming weeks.
Feature 2: User can invite a person from thier contact
#### Login:
